## Ephemera
The Ephemera programming language is my first attempt at language design and compiler implementation from several years ago. 
It's a statically typed language with not many features that compiles to C# and then uses the C# compiler to run.

My goal is to improve the implementation, fix bugs, write tests, update versions of .NET and C#, document my findings and overall gain more knowledge in this field.
For now I plan to preserve the original syntax and semantics of the language and add no new features.

Above all else, my goal is to have fun and I'll keep doing this as long as I derive some joy from the process.
